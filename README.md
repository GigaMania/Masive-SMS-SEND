# SMS-SEND - RUSSIAN PHONE NUMBERS!

We the people of the world have a message to the Russian nation.
A nation that is to pay a huge price because of the shameful decision of the dictator Putin to attack an independent Ukraine by armed forces. The joint action of all the states of the free world, as a response to Russiaâ€™s aggression, will lead to the collapse of the entire country.

However, nearly 150 million Russians do not know the truth about the causes or course of the war in Ukraine. It is fed with the lies of the Kremlin propaganda. There is no free media in Russia and the internet is censored.

It is possible for each of us to convey a direct message to the inhabitants of this enslaved country.
